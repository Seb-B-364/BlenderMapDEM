# üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
This is a python module of functions for creating 3D hillshade maps using Blender. It enables users with minimal Blender knowledge to fetch, clean, and visualize DEM data in the form of beautifully rendered hillshade maps.


This module is ultimately centered around its `renderDEM()` function which interfaces with Blender in order to generate a 3D rendered hillshade map using an input DEM image file.

### What is DEM Data?
A digital elevation model (DEM) is a 3D representation of a terrain's surface, created using remote sensing technologies to model the elevation of the ground. Typically, within a DEM image each pixel carries its elevation data as values closer to white are higher and values closer to black are lower. These images can be fed into Blender to visualize this information in 3D space, creating high quality "hillshade" maps for use in cartography.

<br/>

# üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
- Requirements:
    - [Blender](https://www.blender.org/download/)
    - [OpenTopography API key](https://portal.opentopography.org/lidarAuthorizationInfo?s=api)
    - Python 3.9


- Python dependencies:
    - PIL
    - requests
    - rasterio
    - matplotlib

This module requires an installation of **Blender**, a free and open-source 3D modelling software, in order to utilize the `renderDEM()` function. At the time of writing, this module is working as of Blender 3.5 (latest version) and can be downloaded [here](https://www.blender.org/download/).


This module also requires an [OpenTopography API key](https://portal.opentopography.org/lidarAuthorizationInfo?s=api), obtained for free by creating an account with OpenTopography, in order to to utilize the `fetchDEM()` function. This must be done in order for the function to access the global DEM datasets hosted by OpenTopography through their API.


Please refer to the `demo/` folder of this repository to view a [guided workflow demonstration](demo/demonstration_workbook.ipynb) using the functions of this package in the form of a jupyter notebook as well as find demonstration DEM files in the `demo/data` folder. You can also refer to the [Blender Usage](#usage) section of this document for information on using the `renderDEM()` function.

<br/>

# üîß Installation <a name = "installation"></a>
Please follow these steps to install this package and enable its functionality both with fetching DEM images (using OpenTopography), as well as rendering images (using Blender).

## Step 1: Preliminary Steps
Begin by first downloading [Blender](https://www.blender.org/download/) as well as obtain an [OpenTopography API key](https://portal.opentopography.org/lidarAuthorizationInfo?s=api).

<br/>

## Step 2: Install Package Through Git
Then, to install this module, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/Seb-B-364/BlenderMapDEM.git
```

At this point, all functions within this package **EXCEPT** `renderDEM()` can be used in your own python developer environment. You should now have the ability to fetch and work with DEM data.


The reason you cant use the `renderDEM()` function at this point is because it requires that the `renderDEM.py` module is added to Blender's modules folder so that Blender knows what code to run when the `renderDEM()` function is called. We will do this in the following step.


If you call `renderDEM()` right now in a script you feed to Blender it will raise an error because it doesnt know where that function is. To add it to Blender see the following step.

<br/>

## Step 3: Add renderDEM.py to Blender's Modules Folder
Blender runs on an entirely separate python installation (based on python 3.7) and installing packages/modules with custom functions beyond its defaults can be tricky and tiresome as `pip` does not work natively.


To get around this we can simply add the python file within this package containing the `renderDEM()` function to Blenders own modules folder. This will allow any script that is given to python containing `renderDEM()` to run without errors.


First go to the directory this package was installed in to access its files and **copy** the `renderDEM.py` file (alternatively you could download this repository as a zip file and copy the file from there). By default (on Windows as of python 3.9) this is found here:

`C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python39\Lib\site-packages\BlenderMapDEM`

![alt text](demo/imgs/step3-1.png "Copy renderDEM.py file")

Then **paste** this file into Blender's `scripts/modules` folder so the `renderDEM()` function will be callable by Blender's python interpreter. By default (as of Blender 3.5 on Windows) this folder is found here:

`C:\Program Files\Blender Foundation\Blender 3.5\3.5\scripts\modules`

![alt text](demo/imgs/step3-2.png "Paste renderDEM.py file")

<br/>

## Step 4: Using the Package
You can now `import BlenderMapDEM` and use the functions of this package within your python projects! Here is an example file:

```Python
# Example script which fetches a DEM, converts to image, and renders using Blender
from BlenderMapDEM import *

# Get DEM .geotiff file using fetchDEM()
fetchDEM(north_bound = 13.35,
         south_bound = 13.04,
         east_bound = -59.40,
         west_bound = -59.68,
         API_Key = '8da2375367b589517231f8fee1ae6b7c', # Input API key
         dataset = 'SRTMGL1', # Specify DEM dataset, in this case SRTM 30m resolution
         output_dir = './demo/data/BarbadosDEM.tif') # Specify output directory for map

# Use geotiffToImage() to generate viewable image file from .geotiff DEM file
geotiffToImage('./demo/data/BarbadosDEM.tif', './demo/data/BarbadosDEM_image.png')

# Specifying paths of blender.exe, input DEM image, and output rendered image
blender = 'C:/Program Files/Blender Foundation/Blender 3.5/blender.exe'
DEM =  'C:/Home/Documents/BlenderMapDEM/demo/data/BarbadosDEM_image.png'
output = 'C:/Home/Documents/BlenderMapDEM/demo/data/render.png'

# Use renderDEM to run blender from within this python script
renderDEM(blender_dir = blender, dem_dir = DEM, output_dir = output)
```


For more information on using Blender to execute this script, see the [Blender Usage](#usage) section.

## fetchDEM() <a name = "fetch"></a>
```Python
fetchDEM(north_bound, south_bound, east_bound, west_bound, API_Key, output_dir, dataset = 'SRTMGL1')
```

Uses the OpenTopography API in order to fetch a .GeoTIFF raster image containing DEM data for your specified extent that can then be opened using GIS programs. Fetching data may take a few minutes depending on size of request, this function works best for small extents.


It is important to note that each dataset has limitations on the amount of area it can retrieve, and that fetching DEM data of a very large extent may result in extremely long query times. Requests are limited to 500,000,000 km2 for GEDI L3, 125,000,000 km2 for SRTM15+ V2.1, 4,050,000 km2 for SRTM GL3, COP90 and 450,000 km2 for all other data.


The resulting .GeoTIFF DEM image, while openable in GIS programs, cannot be opened directly by a standard image viewer or Blender. This is so other geospatial operations can be performed on the DEM before it is imported into Blender using its geographic metadata.


**NOTE:** This function requires an OpenTopography API key in order to fetch maps from their database, obtained through [creating an account](https://portal.opentopography.org/newUser) on the OpenTopography website,

<br/>

```

Plots an input DEM .geotiff file using rasterio and matplotlib.

<br/>

Parameters:
- `geotiff_dir: str` **Requires string**
    - The path to the input DEM .geotiff file including file extension.

```

<br/>

## clipDEM() <a name = "crop"></a>
```Python
clipDEM(geotiff_dir, geometry_dir, output_dir, crop = True)
```

Clips an input .geotiff file according to polygon geometry found in a geometry file and saves a clipped .geotiff output file.

<br/>

Parameters:
- `geotiff_dir: str` **Requires string**
    - The path to the input DEM .geotiff file including file extension.
    - Depending on the directory this function is being called in, you can use the relative path prefix `./` like this: `./DEM_here.tif` to select the DEM file in the directory it is called in.
        - Example: `'absolute/path/to/DEM.tif'` or `./relative_path_to_DEM.tif`
- `geometry_dir: str` **Requires string**
    - The path to the input geometry file including file extension.
    - Supported geometry file formats include ".geojson", ".json", and ".shp".
    - For simplicity ".geojson" or ".json" is recommended.
        - If using shapefile as input, make sure all required extra files such as the ".shx" file are located in the same directory.
    - Depending on the directory this function is being called in, you can use the relative path prefix `./` like this: `./DEM_here.geojson` to select the DEM file in the directory it is called in.
        - Example: `'absolute/path/to/DEM.tif'` or `./relative_path_to_DEM.tif`
- `output_dir: str` **Requires string**
    - Directory path of the output clipped .geotiff file including file extension.
    - Depending on the directory this function is being called in, you can use the relative path prefix `./` like this: `./output_here.tif` in order to save the output file in the directory it is called in.
        - Example: `'absolute/path/to/output.tif'` or `./relative_path_to_output.tif`
- `crop: bool` **Requires boolean and defaults to True**
    - Determines if to crop the image to the extent of the clipped geometry (`crop = True`), or if to leave the original extent of the input .geotiff intact, creating an "island" effect (`crop = False`)
    - If `crop = False` is set, all elevation values outside the clipped geometry are set to 0

<br/>

Usage example:
```Python
# The following code clips an input .geotiff DEM file according to a geometry file and saves the clipped .geotiff file

# The original extent is kept with "crop = False", all elevations outside the geometry are just set to 0

clipDEM(geotiff_dir = 'path/to/input/DEM.tif', geometry_dir = 'path/to/geometry.geojson', output_dir = 'path/to/output/DEM_clipped.tif', crop = False)
```

<br/>

## geotiffToImage() <a name = "toimage"></a>
```Python
geotiffToImage(geotiff_dir, output_dir)
```

Converts a .geotiff file (such as one gotten from OpenTopography) to a viewable image file that can be imported by non-GIS programs such as Blender. This allows the user to not have to import the OpenTopography .geotiff DEM file into GIS software and then export it as a viewable rendered image.


It is important to note that the resulting image is currently saved with **8-bit color depth**, meaning that elevation values stored in each pixel can exist in a range from 0-256. This is not ideal however the impacts to the image quality and the resulting 3D renders made from these images are extremely minimal.


It is also important to note that this function outputs an image file that, while readable by image viewers and Blender, is devoid of all geospatial metadata. Use this function towards the end your workflow before `simplifyDEM()` and `renderDEM()` when such metadata is no longer needed to generate a map.

<br/>

Parameters:
- `geotiff_dir: str` **Requires string**
    - Directory of the input DEM .geotiff file including its .tif file extension. 
    - Depending on the directory this function is being called in, you can use the relative path prefix `./` like this: `./DEM_here.tif` to select the DEM file in the directory it is called in.
        - Example: `'absolute/path/to/DEM.tif'` or `./relative_path_to_DEM.tif`
- `output_dir: str` **Requires string**
    - Directory path of the output image file including file extension.
    - Depending on the directory this function is being called in, you can use the relative path prefix `./` like this: `./output_here.tif` in order to save the output file in the directory it is called in.
        - Example: `'absolute/path/to/output.png'` or `./relative_path_to_output.png`
    - While all standard image formats are acceptable as output, **converting the image to .png** is highly recommended as it results in the best quality retention.
    
<br/>

Usage example:
```Python
# The following code takes a non-viewable .geotiff DEM image and convert it into a viewable image that is readable by non-GIS programs such as Blender

geotiffToImage(geotiff_dir = 'path/to/dem.tif', output_dir = 'path/to/output/Image.png')
```

<br/>

## simplifyDEM() <a name = "simplify"></a>
```Python
simplifyDEM(dem_dir, output_dir, reduction_factor = 2)
```

Uses the PIL package to read in an input DEM image (of likely a high resolution) and output a down-sampled image with lower file size and resolution using a resample method appropriate for DEM maps. May be helpful depending on your DEM data source for easing resource requirements when rendering images in Blender.


**NOTE:** this function currently does not work with .GeoTIFF files which contain geospatial metadata and must be opened in GIS programs, this method is intended to be used to prepare a viewable image file before it is imported into Blender to ease computational requirements on computers.

<br/>

Parameters:
- `dem_dir: str` **Requires string**
    - Directory of the input DEM image including its file extension. All standard image file types **except .jpg and .jpeg** are acceptable as input **including .tif/.tiff files**.
    - Depending on the directory this function is being called in, you can use the relative path prefix `./` like this: `./DEM_here.tif` to select the DEM file in the directory it is called in.
        - Example: `'absolute/path/to/DEM.tif'` or `./relative_path_to_DEM.tif`
- `output_dir: str` **Requires string**
    - Directory path of the outputted down-sampled image including its file extension. All standard image file types **except .jpg and .jpeg** are acceptable as output **including .tif/.tiff files**.
    - Depending on the directory this function is being called in, you can use the relative path prefix `./` like this: `./output_here.tif` in order to save the output file in the directory it is called in.
        - Example: `'absolute/path/to/output.tif'` or `./relative_path_to_output.tif`
    - Note that the output file can be the same as the input file and the function will overwrite the input file with the new resolution. This may be convenient for keeping a clean working directory however is more destructive as changes to the file cannot be reverted.
- `reduction_factor: int` **Requires integer and defaults to 2 (halves resolution)**
    - Refers to the integer by which to divide the input DEM resolution by. A `reduction_factor = 4` will result in a down-sampled image with a quarter of the original resolution, whereas a `reduction_factor = 10` will result in a down-sampled image with a tenth of the original resolution.
    - **Must be equal or greater than 2**
    - Be gentle with the amount you reduce the resolution by, depending on the size of your input image, reducing the resolution by more than half could have negative impacts on its clarity in the final rendered image.

<br/>

Usage example:
```Python
# The following code reduces the resolution of the input DEM to be a quarter of its original

simplifyDEM(dem_dir = 'path/to/dem.tif', output_dir = 'path/to/outputRender.png', reduction_factor = 4)
```

<br/>

## renderDEM() <a name = "render"></a>
```Python
renderDEM(blender_dir, dem_dir, output_dir, exaggeration = 0.5, shadow_softness = 90, sun_angle = 45, resolution_scale = 50, samples = 5)
```

Uses Blender to generate a 3D rendered hillshade map using an input DEM image file. The input DEM image must be viewable by non-GIS software, use `geotiffToImage()` to convert fetched DEM data into an image readable by Blender before using this function.


This function uses the subprocess package to automate running Blender through the terminal off of the `renderDEM.py` module added to Blender's modules directory which itself contains the real `renderDEM()` function. This function removes the need to run Blender manually, either through the terminal or GUI, in order to generate a rendered hillshade map using an input DEM.


For more information on using Blender to execute this function, see the [Blender Usage](#renderdemguide) section.

<br/>

Parameters:
- `blender_dir: str` **Requires string**
    - Absolute path to the `blender.exe` executable file found in the installation directory of Blender which the subprocess package will execute using its `subprocess.run()` method.
    - By default (as of Blender 3.5 and on Windows) this path is found here:
        - `C:/Program Files/Blender Foundation/Blender 3.5/blender.exe`
    - If the Blender installation folder is added to your system's `PATH`, meaning it can be called by name in a terminal from any directory, this parameter can be set like this: `blender_dir = 'blender'`.
- `output_dir: str` **Requires string**
    - Directory of the output rendered map including its file extension. All standard image file types are acceptable, **including .tif/.tiff files**.
    - Make sure to specify the absolute path of the output rendered map
        - Example: `output_dir = 'C:/Users/USERNAME/Desktop/render.png'`
- `exaggeration: float` **Requires float and defaults to 0.5**
    - Level of topographic exaggeration to be applied to 3D plane based on input DEM. Higher values will result in "spiky" terrain and darker crevices between landforms when viewed from above.
    - Generally values between 0.3 (relatively flat) to 1 (very spiky) produce good maps however there is no limit to how high this value can go.
    - Note that negative values are possible and will reverse the direction the terrain is exaggerated, "carving" the landscape underground.
- `shadow_softness: int` **Requires integer and defaults to 90 (relatively soft)**
    - This value specifically refers to the angular diameter of the sun's light source however functionally it can be understood as shadow softness.
    - Acceptable values range from 0-180 however best results will come between values of around 10-90; **values below 0 will be treated as 0 and values above 180 will be treated as 180.**
    - Low values (0-10) will result in very hard shadows as if the landscape is on the moon, and higher values (45-90) will result in softer more natural shadows
    - Values approaching 180 may result in unusual shadows.
- `sun_angle: int` **Requires integer and defaults to 45 (degrees)**
    - Vertical angle the sun is shining down on in degrees, mimicking how high the sun is in the sky.
    - Acceptable values range from 0-90; values both above 90 and below 0 are possible however may result in unusual shadows as the sun will shine from realistically impossible angles.
    - For reference a value of 90 will have the sun shining horizontally, a value of 0 will have it shining straight down, and a value of 45 will have it shining diagonally down allowing moderate shadows to be cast on the landforms.
- `resolution_scale: int` **Requires integer and defaults to 50**
    - Scale of the rendered image resolution in relation to the input DEM resolution in the form of percentage. An input DEM with resolution 2000x2000 and a `resolution_scale = 100` will result in a rendered image with resolution 2000x2000 (100% of input DEM), whereas `resolution_scale = 50` will result in a final render of 1000x1000 (50% of input DEM).
    - It is recommended to keep this value around or below 50 while performing test renders to improve speed before raising it to 100 for the final render at full resolution. Has a great affect on render speed and resource load on computer.
- `samples: int` **Requires integer and defaults to 5**
    - Amount of samples to be used in the final render. Samples can be understood as how many "passes" Blender takes over the image during the rendering process, refining the image more and more each sample/pass, making it more clear and less noisy. Has an **extremely large** affect on render speed and resource load on computer.
    - Depending on the strength of your computer it is recommended to keep this value very low (from 1-10) while performing test renders before your final render where you can then raise it to anywhere from 20-500+ for crisp image quality.


When in doubt, the default values of the stylistic parameters `exaggeration`, `shadow_softness`, and `sun_angle` will result in a very readable and realistic hillshade that can then be tweaked conservatively to your liking.

<br/>

Usage example:
```Python
# The following function uses Blender and the subprocess package to render a 3D hillshade map from within a python script


renderDEM(blender_dir = 'C:/Program Files/Blender Foundation/Blender 3.5/blender.exe', dem_dir = 'path/to/dem.tif', output_dir = 'path/to/outputRender.png', exaggeration = 0.5, shadow_softness = 75, sun_angle = 45, resolution_scale = 50, samples = 5)
```

# üó∫Ô∏è Blender Usage <a name = "usage"></a>
There are a variety of ways to use Blender to run python scripts, below you will be instructed on how to trigger Blender to start rendering according to user parameters from within a terminal/python environment using the `renderDEM()` function.
    

Ensure that you have completed all the steps outlined in the [installation section](#installation) which involved adding the `renderDEM.py` file of this repository to Blender's modules folder. This is a crucial step so that Blender knows which code to run when the `renderDEM()` function is called.


Optionally (but less conveniently), Blender can also be run off a python script which imports and calls the `renderDEM()` function found within the `renderDEM.py` file (a process which is being automated by the identically named `renderDEM()` function found within the `BlenderMapDEM.py` file). This can either be done in the terminal or using the "Scripting" workspace within Blender's GUI. Keep in mind using such a method is only useful if you wish to generate the map and explore the created Blender project instead of having it automatically render, save, and close.

<br/>

## üñ•Ô∏è Render Map from Python Script Using renderDEM() <a name = "renderdemguide"></a>
To run Blender from within a python script (such as the same one which fetched, manipulated, and then converted a DEM map to an image file), simply use the `renderDEM()` function.


The following method is very similar to running Blender as a terminal instance and specifying a path to a python script to run off of (done through specifying the command line arguments of `--background` and `--python`), however it does this within a python script itself using the `subprocess` package.


This way all functions in this package can be run from within a single python file, allowing you to make use of all functions from `fetchDEM()` to `renderDEM()` without having to leave your python development environment so long as you correctly point the `renderDEM()` function to Blender's executable file.


This function takes in 3 required parameters and uses the `subprocess` package to automate the process of running Blender in the terminal according to these parameters:
- `blender_dir` which points to the directory of Blender's executable file.
- `DEM_dir` which points to the input directory of the DEM image you wish to produce a map of.
- `output_dir` which points to the output directory that the rendered image should be saved to.


```Python
# Example script which fetches a DEM, converts to image, and renders using Blender
from BlenderMapDEM import *

# Get DEM .geotiff file using fetchDEM()
fetchDEM(north_bound = 13.35,
         south_bound = 13.04,
         east_bound = -59.40,
         west_bound = -59.68,
         API_Key = '8da2375367b589517231f8fee1ae6b7c', # Input API key
         dataset = 'SRTMGL1', # Specify DEM dataset, in this case SRTM 30m resolution
         output_dir = './demo/data/BarbadosDEM.tif') # Specify output directory for map

# Use geotiffToImage() to generate viewable image file from .geotiff DEM file
geotiffToImage('./demo/data/BarbadosDEM.tif', './demo/data/BarbadosDEM_image.png')

# Specifying paths of blender.exe, input DEM image, and output rendered image
blender = 'C:/Program Files/Blender Foundation/Blender 3.5/blender.exe'
DEM =  'C:/Home/Documents/BlenderMapDEM/demo/data/BarbadosDEM_image.png'
output = 'C:/Home/Documents/BlenderMapDEM/demo/data/render.png'

# Use renderDEM() to run blender from within this python script
renderDEM(blender_dir = blender, dem_dir = DEM, output_dir = output)
```


The resulting image:

## üí° Usage Tips <a name = "tips"></a>
For `renderDEM()`, It is recommended to start with **very** conservative quality settings (arguments of `resolution_scale` and `samples`) so that you are able to quickly perform many test renders while you fine-tune the stylistic arguments before your final high-quality render. This is because different input maps may have better readability with certain scale exaggerations, colors, shadows, etc. and rendering a high-quality map every time to tweak these parameters would require an unnecessary amount of time and resources.


Use [latlong.net](https://www.latlong.net/) to help you find the north, south, east, and west bounds of your chosen area to use with the `fetchDEM()` function.


Use [geojson.io](https://geojson.io/) to create vector polygons to use as clipping geometries with the `clipDEM()` function.
